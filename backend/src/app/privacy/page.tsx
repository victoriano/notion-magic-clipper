      <p>
        This extension and its companion backend ("Service") help you save the current web page into
        your Notion database and optionally use an AI model to auto-fill properties. We collect and
        process the minimum data necessary to provide this functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>What data we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Website content (page you choose to save).</b> When you click the extension, we read
          the current tab to extract the page URL, title, metadata, selected text, a short text
          sample, article content (when available), and candidate images.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Authentication information you provide.</b> You may optionally store API keys (OpenAI /
          Google AI) and link your Notion workspace via OAuth. These credentials are stored locally
          in the extension's
          <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. Workspace access tokens may be retrieved from the
          backend after you complete the OAuth flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Basic account status (from backend).</b> After logging in, the popup may display that
          you are logged in (e.g., your Notion account email). This is fetched from the backend to
          show your status and is not used for tracking.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Send the selected page content to Notion to create a page in your chosen database.</li>
        <li>
          Optionally send text snippets to the AI provider you configure (OpenAI or Google) to map
          content to Notion properties or generate concise page blocks, if enabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perform OAuth with Notion to link your workspace and obtain tokens needed to save pages on
          your behalf.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data sharing</h2>
      <p>Data may be transmitted only to the following services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Notion API</b> (api.notion.com) — to search databases and create pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>AI provider (optional)</b> — OpenAI (api.openai.com) or Google AI
          (generativelanguage.googleapis.com) when you enable model-assisted filling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Backend</b> — for OAuth flows (link/disconnect workspaces) and to fetch
          workspace-scoped tokens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Storage and retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Local only.</b> Preferences, API keys, and workspace tokens are stored locally in the
          extension storage on your device and remain until you clear them (Settings → Clear local
          data) or uninstall the extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No analytics and no ads.</b> We do not sell user data or use it for advertising or
          credit decisions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We never execute remote code. All scripts are packaged with the extension and declared in
          the manifest.
        </li>
        <li>Credentials are transmitted only to the selected providers over HTTPS.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can use the extension without AI by not providing any AI key.</li>
        <li>
          You can clear all locally stored data from the Tokens page in the popup at any time.
        </li>
        <li>You can disconnect workspaces from the Tokens page or via your Notion account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

        We may update this policy. We will post any changes on this page and update the effective
        date above.
